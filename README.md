System Manipulation and Restoration: Creating and Fixing Malicious Injects

This project aims to explore and demonstrate the effects of system manipulation by purposefully introducing a series of injects that disrupt a computer's functionality. The project will then go further by providing detailed solutions to reverse these disruptions, restoring the system to its normal state. The injects will be carefully crafted to alter critical system operations, introduce fake data, and cause unusual behavior across both Windows 10 Server and Windows 10 Workstation systems. The goal is to showcase the impact of these changes and highlight practical methods to undo them, providing insights into both system vulnerabilities and recovery techniques.
